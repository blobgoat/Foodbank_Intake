## Developers Manual
Welcome to the developer's manual. Here is everything you need to start contributing to our project:


## Tools
The only requirement for this project is to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed. Instructions can be found in the link. Our project uses version 11.3.0 and has no guarantees for other versions, though higher versions should work. Instructions on how to install dependencies are under [Usage](#Usage)

## Core Functionality
TODO: write core functionality of foodbank intake form

## Repository Layout
There are two directories, a frontend `client` and a `backend server`. Each is it's own project, detailed below. In addition, there is a `documentation` directory that provides further details about our project. Development, building, and testing will be detailed below under [Usage](#Usage).

### documentation/
This is a container for documentation useful to those that interact with the repository.  Includes:
- `documentation/guest_doc.md` to act as a user guide for guests of the foodbank.
- `documentation/volunteer_doc.md` to be an instruction manual for volunteers.
- `documentation/dev_doc.md` to include further specifications for developers.
- `documentation/threat_assessment` to include an assessment of the specific security risks we have identified.

### client/
This is a React/TypeScript application that represents our frontend. It is an interface for users to input information into the intake process. Contains both dependency information for the **Volunteer Hub local website**  and the corresponding code.
Includes:
- `client/package.json` to specify the dependencies of the local website.
- `client/src` to contain the source code.
- `client/src/__test__` contains automated tests for the local website.

### server/
This is a Node.js server that abstracts away all the interactions with our inernal data and logic.
Includes:
- `server/package.json` to specify the dependencies of the local website.
- `server/__test__` contains automated tests of the local website.
- `server/src` contains non trivial code for complex functions such as flagging before it enters the aws database.

## Usage
Begin by cloning or forking this repository. There is sufficient documentation for this process online. Install npm on the machine containing the repository; you will need to invoke commands of the form `npm ...` to use this project. If warnings appear while using npm, try running `npm doctor`.

### .env

TODO: write env documentation

### Dependencies
To install requried dependencies:
1. `cd server` to enter the server directory
2. `npm install` to install all server dependencies
3. `cd ../client` to enter the client directory (this assumes you are currently in server, modify this command depending on your current directory to take you to the client directory)
4. `npm install` to install all client dependencies

### Development

TODO: describe specific ports and how to run it localy for development and testing.


### Building

TODO: go through specifics of how to build the project


### Testing
For testing, our client and server side uses Vitest and our server uses Jest. To run the automated tests, `cd` into the server or client folder and run `npm run test` to run tests. For the client you can also run `npm run coverage` for a code coverage report.

To write your own client side Vitest tests:
- Locate that `__test__` folder under `client/src/__test__`
- If you wish to set up your own tests, right click the `__test__` folder and select New File. Otherwise edit or add to the existing tests we have.
- Use this template to write your tests. We do not require any specific guidelines, but your tests should be modular, readable, and well documented.

```Javascript
import {expect, test} from 'vitest';
import { demo_sum } from '../utils/utils';  // import what you want to test

test('A descriptive test name', () => {
  expect(demo_sum(1, 2)).toBe(3)  // expects the return value of demo_sum(1, 2) to be 3

  // similar tests should be grouped together
})

// other related but different tests

```

To write your own server side Jest tests:
- Locate that `__test__` folder under `server/__test__`
- If you wish to set up your own tests, right click the `__test__` folder and select New File. Otherwise edit or add to the existing tests we have.
- Use this template to write your tests. We do not require any specific guidelines, but your tests should be modular, readable, and well documented.
- following the describe.each format makes it easier to add test cases and paramerize input. optionally you can create your own name for the test case, or you can just put the inputs as $input
-for large mock data use a .ts file to declare and export it to not dirty the test scripts with an insummountable amount of information

```Javascript
import {expect, test} from 'vitest';
import { demo_sum } from '../utils/utils';  // import what you want to test
describe.each([
    {
      name: 'descriptivename'
      input: 'values'
      expect: 'expected output'
    }])('function_name - $name', ({ input, expected }) => {
it('descriptive subtest name', () => {
  expect(demo_sum(values)).toBe(expected)  // expects the return value of demo_sum(1, 2) to be 3

  // similar tests should be grouped together
});
});

// async test for data pipelining can be written in a single test format
test('A descriptive async test name', async () => {
    const result = await foo();
    expect(result).toBe(true);
});
```
